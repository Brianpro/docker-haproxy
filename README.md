# aasmith/docker-haproxy
HAProxy compiled against newer/faster libraries (PCRE w/ JIT, SLZ, and LibreSSL).

This haproxy docker image uses statically-linked modern libraries where
possible. Otherwise, it attempts to follow the official docker image as
closely as possible. Substitute the image name where needed, as in the example
below.

## Usage

Example `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM aasmith/haproxy
COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

To pin to a specific version, use the branch or tag:

```
FROM aasmith/haproxy:1.6 # stay on the latest the 1.6 line
```

```
FROM aasmith/haproxy:1.6.8 # use exactly 1.6.8
```

### Lua

A lua version is also available on the `lua` branch:

```
FROM aasmith/haproxy:lua # latest lua
```

```
FROM aasmith/haproxy:lua-1.6.8
```

The lua version also includes the luarocks package manager.

For more information about using these images, see the offical docker image
instructions at https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/haproxy#how-to-use-this-image.

## Libraries

### PCRE

Enables PCRE JIT compilation for faster regular expression parsing. The [PCRE
Peformance Project][0] has more information on benchmarks, etc.

Compilation follows as close as possible to the [debian package][1], excluding
C++ support and dynamic linking.

[0]: http://sljit.sourceforge.net/pcre.html
[1]: https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=pcre3&arch=i386&ver=2%3A8.35-3.3%2Bdeb8u2&stamp=1452484092

### Stateless Zip (SLZ)

Created by the HAProxy maintainer, SLZ is a stream compressor for producing
gzip-compatible output. It has lower memory usage, no dictionary persistence,
and runs about 3x faster than zlib.

See the [Stateless Zip project][2] for background, benchmarks, etc.

### LibreSSL

An OpenSSL-compatible replacement, ["with goals of modernizing the codebase, 
improving security, and applying best practice development processes"][3]
